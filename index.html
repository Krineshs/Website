                Embarking on a journey of self-directed learning, I've achieved notable certifications, including CCNA 1, CCNA Routing & Switching Essentials, and a specialized CCNA in Security, as part of my dedication to advancing my knowledge in networking and cybersecurity. To augment my theoretical understanding with hands-on experience, I've transformed my home environment into an expansive learning space. This setup includes a Palo Alto 220 firewall, diverse servers such as HP DL 380p, HP DL 360p, Cisco UCS, and an HP Microserver, complemented by a meticulously configured HP 3100 switch. Within this dynamic ecosystem, I've implemented various services, ranging from a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to a VPN server, and orchestrated a variety of virtual machines running Windows, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and TrueNAS. In parallel, I am actively working on creating a Web Application Firewall (WAF) using pfSense, adding another layer to my practical expertise in the dynamic field of networking and security. This hands-on approach reflects my commitment to bridging theoretical knowledge with innovative and applicable solutions.
